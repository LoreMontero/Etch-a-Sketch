# Etch-a-Sketch

1. Create a layout of your design with HTML and CSS.
2. Create a container that has a 16 by 16 grid by default with javascript.
3. Set up an on click event listener function.
4. For this event listener choose a color you want to sketch with.
5. Make another event listener but this time create one that listens for a mouse hover event.
6. On the mouse hover event add another class to the div you hovered over.
